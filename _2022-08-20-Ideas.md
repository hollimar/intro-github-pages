## Ideas for Training/Learning Platform
Here are some quick notes on what I have in mind for a training/learing platform. This basic structure might be used for people to learn anything from website design and coding, to learning to be antiracist.
- Start with an idea
  - Help them form an idea
  - Provide examples
  - Walk them through
- Build on the idea
- Begin to build a plan
- Explore tools and resources
  - Are there existing resources to help with the idea
  - What is the best tool for the job 
So let's start building!
